        <h1>Hychyn</h1>
        <img src="../images/hychyn.jpeg" alt="hychyn">
        <p>Hychyn (or khychin) is a traditional Caucasian flatbread stuffed with various filings like potatoes, cheese, or ground meat. To make it, prepare a soft dough using flour, kefir (or yogurt), salt, and baking soda. Let it rest for 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, make your filing — for example, mashed potatoes mixed with crumbled cheese (like suluguni or feta) or sautéed ground beef with onions and spices.</p>
        <p>Divide the dough into balls, roll each one out, place a spoonful of filing in the center, and seal it like a pouch. Gently flatten into a thick disc, then cook each hychyn on a dry hot skillet until golden on both sides. Brush with butter and serve warm — perfect with sour cream or tea.</p>
