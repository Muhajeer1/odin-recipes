        <p>Manti are traditional steamed dumplings popular across Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Turkey. They are typically filled with spiced ground meat and onions, then steamed until tender. Soft, juicy, and flavorful, manti are often served with yogurt, sour cream, or garlic sauce.</p>
        
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 egg (optional)</li>
            <li>300–400g ground beef or lamb</li>
            <li>1 large onion (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour and salt, add water (and egg if using), knead into a firm dough. Let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine ground meat, finely chopped onion, salt, pepper, and spices in a bowl. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough thin and cut into squares (~8–10 cm). Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each. Fold and pinch the edges tightly to seal in a classic manti shape (like a pouch or boat).</li>
            <li>Place manti in a greased steamer or stacked steamer tray. Steam for 40–45 minutes over boiling water.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with sour cream, melted butter, or a garlicky yogurt sauce.</li>
        </ol>
